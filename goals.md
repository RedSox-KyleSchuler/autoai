# Goals

- [ ] Update the code to adjust the prompt to suggest 1 specific change at a time, after looking at all the goals, and any other changes that might be recommended, to add them to the goals, as long as they don't conflict with the other goals, or are not duplicates
- [ ] Update the code to ask for a user to approve a code push, and after approval, push the code to github using git, wait for it to be updated, and then rerun the whole process
- [ ] Develop a system to automatically generate and improve code based on user input and interactions with the OpenAI API
- [ ] Continuously monitor and improve the code generation process by analyzing feedback from users and the OpenAI API
- [ ] Explore and integrate new libraries to improve the code generation process


# Previous Goals

- [x] Create a Python program to gather files and metadata from a local repository and interact with the OpenAI API to suggest changes and generate new code
- [x] Develop a prompt to ask the OpenAI API to access a GitHub repository, read the readme file, and suggest specific changes to the code
- [x] Create a PowerShell script to generate the necessary files and folders for the program

# Todos

- [ ] Implement the suggestions from the OpenAI API into the codebase
- [ ] Continuously test and refine the program's code generation capabilities
- [ ] Expand the program's capabilities to include more programming languages and libraries
- [ ] Develop a more specific and targeted goal for the program based on user feedback and needs
